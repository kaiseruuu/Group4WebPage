    <h1>Problems of students that are encountered in the STEM strand?</h1>
    <h2>
      While we all are all pumped up about the advantages of STEM education and
      how it can work for the betterment of our society, STEM has still a long
      way to go ahead. Beneath any issues which might arise in knowledge of
      content, many students with good grades in mathematics seem to find it
      difficult to apply the mathematical knowledge that they might have. Why
      would this be the case?
    </h2>
    <h3>Overly Procedural thinking</h3>
    <p>
      Mathematics exams can often be passed by learning the content
      procedurally. This means that students can answer certain types of
      question by following a recipe. The problems in scientific mathematics
      arise because even minor deviations from the precise recipe cause the
      student to fail to know what to do.
    </p>
    <h3>Lack of ability to translate mathematical</h3>
    <p>
      Meaning to real-world meaning Students who are very skilled at mathematics
      might have trouble seeing how to relate the mathematical process to a
      real-world context; this hampers the use of common sense, so valuable in
      quantitative science.
    </p>
    <h3>Lack of practice</h3>
    <p>
      There are two ways in which lack of practice can impact mathematical
      activity in the sciences. First is a lack of skill at basic numerical or
      symbolic. This leads to errors and hold-ups regardless of whether the
      student understands what they are trying to do. Second is a lack of
      practice at thinking mathematically in a scientific context.
    </p>
    <h3>Lack of interest</h3>
    <p>
      Lack of interest can be caused by difficultly concentrating, family
      problems, emotional difficulties, learning disabilities, and many other
      factors. Sometimes it's just plain boredom not everything is about fun all
      the time

      Steps or tips on how to not get crammed in the activities for the strand
      STEM
    </h2>
    <h3>Positive Thinking</h3>
    <p>
      Positive thinking does not necessarily mean avoiding difficult situations.
      Instead, positive thinking means making the most of potential obstacles,
      trying to see the best in other people, and viewing yourself and your
      abilities in a positive light.
    </p>
    <h3>Time Management</h3>
    <p>
      Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide
      your time between different activities. Get it right, and you'll end up
      working smarter, not harder, to get more done in less time â€“ even when
      time is tight and pressures are high.
    </p>
    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <p>
      Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally,
      understanding the logical connection between ideas.
